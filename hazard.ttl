      :definition """Tsunami created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, meteorite or generated by meteorological or atmospheric disturbances.
Primary hazards/Damages
•	Damage and destruction from tsunamis is the direct result of three factors: inundation, wave impact on structures, and erosion. Deaths occur by drowning and physical impact or other trauma when people are caught in the turbulent, debris-laden tsunami waves. Strong tsunami-induced currents have led to the erosion of foundations and the collapse of bridges and seawalls. Floatation and drag forces have moved houses and overturned railroad cars.

•	Tsunami associated wave forces have demolished frame buildings and other structures. Considerable damage also is caused by floating debris, including boats, cars, and trees that become dangerous projectiles that may crash into buildings, piers, and other vehicles. Ships and port facilities have been damaged by surge action caused by even weak tsunamis. Fires resulting from oil spills or combustion from damaged ships in port, or from ruptured coastal oil storage and refinery facilities, can cause damage greater than that inflicted directly by the tsunami. 
Secondary hazards/ Damages
•	Secondary hazard/damage can result from sewage and chemical pollution following the destruction. Damage of intake, discharge, and storage facilities also can present dangerous problems. Of increasing concern is the potential effect of tsunami drawdown, when receding waters uncover cooling water intakes associated with nuclear power plants."""@en ;

Time of the first maximum of the tsunami waves."""@en ;
      :definition """Inundation (maximum)
Maximum horizontal penetration of the tsunami from the shoreline. A maximum inundation is measured for each different coast or harbour affected by the tsunami."""@en ;
      :definition """Inundation area
Area flooded with water by the tsunami."""@en ;
      :definition """Inundation height
Elevation reached by seawater measured relative to a stated datum such as mean sea level or the sea level
at the time of tsunami arrival, at a specified inundation distance. Inundation height is the sum of the flow depth and the local topographic height. Sometimes referred to as tsunami height."""@en ;
      :definition """Inundation line
Inland limit of wetting, measured horizontally from the mean sea level (MSL) line. The line between living and dead vegetation is sometimes used as a reference. In tsunami science, the landward limit of tsunami runup."""@en ;
      :definition """Inundation or Inundation-distance
The horizontal distance inland that a tsunami penetrates, generally measured perpendicularly to the shoreline."""@en ;
      :definition """Leading wave
First arriving wave of a tsunami. In some cases, the leading wave produces an initial depression or drop in sea level, and in other cases, an elevation or rise in sea level. When a drop in sea level occurs, sea level recession is observed."""@en ;
      :definition """Mean height
Average height of a tsunami measured from the trough to the crest after removing the tidal variation."""@en ;
      :definition """Runup
1. Difference between the elevation of maximum tsunami penetration (inundation line) and the sea level at the time of the tsunami. In practical terms, run up is only measured where there is a clear evidence of the inundation limit on the shore.

2. Elevation reached by seawater measured relative to some stated datum such as mean sea level, mean low water, sea level at the time of the tsunami attack, etc., and measured ideally at a point that is a local maximum of the horizontal inundation. Where the elevation is not measured at the maximum of horizontal inundation, this is often referred to as the inundation-height."""@en ;
      :definition """Travel time
Time required for the first tsunami wave to propagate from its source to a given point on a coastline."""@en ;
      :definition """Tsunami amplitude
Usually measured on a sea level record, it is 1) the absolute value of the difference between a particular peak or trough of the tsunami and the undisturbed sea level at the time, 2) half the difference between an adjacent peak and trough, corrected for the change of tide between that peak and trough. It is intended to represent the true amplitude of the tsunami wave at some point in the ocean. However, it is often an amplitude modified in some way by the tide gauge response."""@en ;
      :definition """Tsunami period

Amount of time that a tsunami wave takes to complete a cycle, or one wavelength. Tsunami periods typically range from 5-60 minutes. Tsunami period is often measured as the difference between the arrival time of the highest peak and the next one measured on a water level record.""" ;
      :definition """Tsunami wavelength
The horizontal distance between similar points on two successive waves measured perpendicular to the crest. The wavelength and the tsunami period give information on the tsunami source. For tsunamis generated by earthquakes, the typical wavelength ranges from 20 to 300 km. For tsunamis generated by landslides, the wavelength is much shorter, ranging from 100s of metres to 10s of kilometres. (pages 14-26)"""@en ;

A series of travelling waves of extremely long length and period, usually generated by disturbances associated with earthquakes occurring below or near the ocean floor. (Also called seismic sea wave and, incorrectly, tidal wave). Volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides, and coastal rock falls can also generate tsunamis, as can a large meteorite impacting the ocean. These waves may reach enormous dimensions and travel across entire ocean basins with little loss of energy. They proceed as ordinary gravity waves with a typical period between 10 and 60 minutes. Tsunamis steepen and increase in height on approaching shallow water, inundating low-lying areas, and where local submarine topography causes the waves to steepen, they may break and cause great damage. Tsunamis have no connection with tides; the popular name, tidal wave, is entirely misleading. (ref p12)"@en ;
